This is my team and mine official submission to nwHacks 2021: 
We explore the usage of QR codes in world of music.
We will most likely be making 3 types of QR codes:
- One that holds link to a external audio file
- One that holds details about audio file(Meta Data) and method to retrieve the midi data from a online source
- One that holds the true midi data and is complete on its own,just need a synthesiser to play it.
